Remember that:
1.
 when we say we are using any property then it means we not need to provide perenthises with it.
for example: if we take 
                        const newString = "Abinav"
                        console.log(newString.length) Output : 6
            Therefore we are using property hear and .length is a property
And when we are using any function then it means it will have to provide perenthises with it.
for example: if we take 
                        const otherNumber = 123.5794
                        console.log(otherNumber.toPrecision()); Output : 124
            Therefore we are using the function hear
